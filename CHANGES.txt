hurry.workflow changes
======================

0.12 (2012-02-10)
=================

* Make the info() and state() functions on the WorkflowInfo class into
  classmethods as they are not of much use otherwise.

* fireTransitionToward already accepted a check_security=False
  argument, but it would not allow a transition that a user didn't
  have the permission for to be fired after all, because the
  transition wouldn't even be found in the first place. Now it works.

0.11 (2010-04-16)
=================

* Do IAnnotations(self.context) only once in WorkflowState.

* An IWorkflowVersions implementation is now optional.

* Added multiple workflows support.

0.10 (2009-11-19)
=================

* Moved to svn.zope.org for development.

* Added a buildout.cfg, bootstrap.py

* Minimized dependencies. Note that ``Workflow`` does not inherit from
  ``Persistent`` and ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
  anymore. If you need persistent workflow, you need to subclass this
  in your own code. This breaks backwards compatibility, as persistent
  workflows would need to be re-initialized.

====================

Bug fixes
---------

* Oops, the patches in 0.9.2 were not actually applied. Fixed them
  now.
