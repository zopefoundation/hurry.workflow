CHANGES
=======

3.0.2 (2018-01-16)
------------------

- Update rendering of pypi description.

3.0.1 (2018-01-16)
------------------

- Fix up a brown paper bag release.

3.0.0 (2018-01-16)
------------------

- Update dependencies not to rely on ZODB 3 anymore.

- Support python3.4, python3.5, python3.6 in addition to python2.7.

0.13.1 (2013-01-17)
-------------------

- Make the exceptions also display more informative messages.

0.13 (2013-01-17)
-----------------

- ``NoTransitionAvailableError`` gained a ``source`` and ``destination``
  attribute indicating what transition wasn't available.

- ``AmbiguousTransitionError`` also gained a ``source`` and ``destination``
  attribute indicating what transition was ambiguous.

- ``InvalidTransitionError`` gained a ``source`` attribute indicating
  the source state of the attempted invalid transition.

- Newer ``bootstrap.py``

0.12 (2012-02-10)
-----------------

- Make the info() and state() functions on the WorkflowInfo class into
  classmethods as they are not of much use otherwise.

- fireTransitionToward already accepted a check_security=False
  argument, but it would not allow a transition that a user didn't
  have the permission for to be fired after all, because the
  transition wouldn't even be found in the first place. Now it works.

0.11 (2010-04-16)
-----------------

- Do IAnnotations(self.context) only once in WorkflowState.

- An IWorkflowVersions implementation is now optional.

- Added multiple workflows support.

0.10 (2009-11-19)
-----------------

- Moved to svn.zope.org for development.

- Added a buildout.cfg, bootstrap.py

- Minimized dependencies. Note that ``Workflow`` does not inherit from
  ``Persistent`` and ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
  anymore. If you need persistent workflow, you need to subclass this
  in your own code. This breaks backwards compatibility, as persistent
  workflows would need to be re-initialized.

0.9.2.1 (2007-08-15)
--------------------

- Oops, the patches in 0.9.2 were not actually applied. Fixed them
  now.

0.9.2 (2007-08-15)
------------------

- zope.security changes broke imports in hurry.workflow.

- localUtility directive is now deprecated, so don't use it anymore.

0.9.1 (2006-09-22)
------------------

- first cheesehop release.

0.9 (2006-06-15)
----------------
- separate out from hurry package into hurry.workflow

- eggification work

- Zope 3.3 compatibility work

0.8 (2006-05-01)
----------------
